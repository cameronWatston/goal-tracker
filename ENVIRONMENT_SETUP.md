## üéØ Key Points for AdSense Setup

### 1. **Environment Variable is Required**
The `GOOGLE_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID` must be set in your `.env` file for the automatic AdSense system to work properly.

### 2. **Getting Your AdSense Client ID**
1. Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Go to "Ads" ‚Üí "Overview"
4. Find your AdSense client ID (format: `ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
5. Copy the full ID including the `ca-pub-` prefix

### 3. **Testing vs Production**
- **Development**: Use `ca-pub-0000000000000000` (test mode)
- **Production**: Use your real AdSense client ID

### 4. **Security Best Practices**
- Never commit your `.env` file to Git
- Use different values for development/staging/production
- Keep your AdSense client ID secure

## üöÄ Quick Setup Commands

1. **Create your .env file:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the template above into a new .env file
   # Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Verify AdSense is working:**
   - Login as admin: `admin` / `admin123`
   - Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí AdSense Analytics
   - Check that your client ID is displayed correctly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### Port Already in Use
If you see "EADDRINUSE" error:
```bash
# Kill any existing Node processes
taskkill /f /im node.exe

# Or change the port in .env
PORT=3002
```

### AdSense Not Loading
- Ensure `GOOGLE_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID` is set in `.env`
- Check that the format is correct: `ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- Verify you're logged in as a free user (premium users don't see ads)

### Email Not Working
- Use Gmail App Password, not your regular password
- Enable 2-factor authentication on Gmail first
- Generate app password from Google Account settings

## üîÑ Environment Variables Priority

The application loads environment variables in this order:
1. `.env` file (highest priority)
2. System environment variables
3. Default values in code (lowest priority)

This means your `.env` file will always override any default values!
