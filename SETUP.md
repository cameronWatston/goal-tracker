## Environment Variables Setup

To enable all features including the new AI chat functionality, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=

# Persistent Disk Configuration (for Render deployment)
# Set this to your mounted disk path (e.g., /data) when using Render persistent disks
# Leave empty for local development (will use ./db)
DB_PATH=

# Session Configuration
SESSION_SECRET=your-very-secret-session-key-here



# Stripe Configuration (for paid subscriptions)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key

# OpenAI Configuration (Required for AI Chat feature)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=development

```

## OpenAI API Key Setup

1. Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key and add it to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Persistent Disk Setup (Render Deployment)

If you prefer to use SQLite with persistent storage on Render instead of PostgreSQL:

### Step 1: Add a Persistent Disk to your Render service

1. Go to your service in the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Disks** ‚Üí **Add Disk**
3. Configure the disk:
   - **Name**: `goal-tracker-data`
   - **Mount Path**: `/data`
   - **Size**: 1GB (or as needed)

### Step 2: Set the environment variable

In your Render service environment variables, add:
```
DB_PATH=/data
```

### Step 3: Deploy

Your app will automatically:
- Create the database directory at `/data` if it doesn't exist
- Store all SQLite databases (`database.sqlite`, `sessions.sqlite`) in the persistent disk
- Preserve data across deployments

### Local Development

For local development, leave `DB_PATH` empty in your `.env` file. The app will automatically use the local `./db` directory.

### Testing Your Configuration

To verify your database configuration is working correctly:

```bash
npm run test-db
```

This will show:
- Current database configuration (local vs persistent disk)
- Database file locations
- Connection status
- Basic database health check
